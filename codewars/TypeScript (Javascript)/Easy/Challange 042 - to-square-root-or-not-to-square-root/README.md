```
Write a method, that will get an integer array as parameter and will process every number from this array.
Return a new array with processing every number of the input-array like this:

If the number has an integer square root, take this, otherwise square the number.

[4,3,9,7,2,1] -> [2,9,3,49,4,1]
```

```
function squareOrSquareRoot(array) {
  return array.map(x => {
    const r = Math.sqrt(x);
    return (r % 1 == 0) ? r : (x*x);
  });
}
```
