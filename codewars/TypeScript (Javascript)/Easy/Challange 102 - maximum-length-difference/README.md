# The Challange

https://www.codewars.com/kata/maximum-length-difference/train/javascript

```
You are given two arrays a1 and a2 of strings. Each string is composed with letters from a to z. Let x be any string in the first array and y be any string in the second array.

Find max(abs(length(x) − length(y)))

If a1 and/or a2 are empty return -1 in each language except in Haskell (F#) where you will return Nothing (None).

#Example:

a1 = ["hoqq", "bbllkw", "oox", "ejjuyyy", "plmiis", "xxxzgpsssa", "xxwwkktt", "znnnnfqknaz", "qqquuhii", "dvvvwz"]
a2 = ["cccooommaaqqoxii", "gggqaffhhh", "tttoowwwmmww"]
mxdiflg(a1, a2) --> 13
```

```
function mxdiflg(a1, a2) {
  if (a1.length === 0 || a2.length === 0) return -1
  let l1 = a1.map(str => str.length)
  let l2 = a2.map(str => str.length)
  return Math.max(Math.max(...l1) - Math.min(...l2), Math.max(...l2) - Math.min(...l1))
}
